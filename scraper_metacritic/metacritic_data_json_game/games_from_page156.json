In the morning, they wake up with no recollection of what happened or where they were.Some teenagers in this town woke up during a few of these \"Blackouts\" themselves, finding themselves in the woods or on train tracks with no idea how they got there. When they tell their parents, their teachers, the police... no one believes them. Taking matters into their own hands, they formed a club -- The Blackout Club -- to get to the bottom of it. Unfortunately, the recent disappearance of a close friend means that the sleepwalking isn't just strange - it could be deadly.You and your friends must team up to overcome the powerful forces that are arrayed against you. Using tools such as drones, noisemakers, and grappling hooks, you will outwit and outmaneuver the adults while attempting to obtain and record evidence that will prove what is happening to the rest of the world. With procedural elements that change goals, enemies, loot and more, no two nights in the neighborhood will be the same.\u2026 Expand"}, {"name": "Empire of Sin", "details_link": "https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/empire-of-sin", "publisher": "Paradox Interactive", "release_date": "Dec  1 2020", "developers": ["Romero Games Ltd."], "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "Switch", "Xbox One", "PC"], "num_players": "No Online Multiplayer", "genres": ["Action Adventure", "General"], "meta_score": 63, "users_score": 5.9, "image": "https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/5/a02faf911066eb1fce11d961043a82b0-98.jpg", "descriptions": "Empire of sin, the strategy game from romero games and Paradox interactive, puts you at the heart of the ruthless criminal underworld of 1920S prohibition-era Chicago.

As a result of the polar ice cap melting, the Mississippi River has destroyed the central portion of the United States, causing an ill-equipped Federal Government to fail and literally cutting the country in half. These two halves are left to fend for themselves in the aftermath. The East, now known as the Atlantic Alliance, symbolic of their union with Europe, puts its faith in surviving this new world in cybernetics, an established yet evolving technology now more than 150 years old. On the other side of the flooded continent, the Western states, now called the Republic of Pacifica and having allied with Asia, resort to solving their problems at the genetic level, effectively restructuring the DNA of its inhabitants -- a method the Atlantic Alliance finds morally reprehensible. By 2161, it only takes a hint of unauthorized military preparation in Pacifica for the newly restored president to order a strike in the heart of Pacifican territory -- an outpost in the now dry San Francisco Bay. This strike leads to the unthinkable: an epic conflict with global implications fought on U.S. soil. As a soldier in this struggle, Mason Briggs uses explosive, terrain-deforming weaponry to change the face of battle: He not only destroys the land in his path, he outright transforms it to gain the strategic advantage in completely unscripted ways no game has ever seen. With such a devastating arsenal at hand, Briggs never leaves any battlefield the way he found it. In addition to weaponry that allows players to do things previously only imagined, each side of the conflict, Pacifica and the Atlantic Alliance, boast soldiers with powers beyond those of ordinary men. Genetic augmentations provide Pacifican forces with amazing abilities, while Atlantic Alliance soldiers like Briggs counter the threat with the more \"traditional\" method: cybernetics. The differing states of superhumanity result in balanced yet stylistically different combat tactics that have never been seen before.

Now, Call of Cthulhu will bring the mythos to life like never before, on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC.\r In this world, nothing is as it seems. Sanity is an irregular bedfellow, all too often replaced by the whisperings in the dark. Strange creatures, weird science, and shadowy cults dominate the Cthulhu Mythos, intent on realizing their mad schemes to bring about the end of everything. Your mind will suffer -- balancing a razor-thin line between sanity and madness, your senses will be disrupted until you question the reality of everything around you. Trust no one. Creeping shadows hide lurking figures... and all the while, the Great Dreamer prepares for his awakening.\u2026 Expand"}, {"name": "OVERPASS", "details_link": "https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/overpass", "publisher": "Bigben Interactive", "release_date": "Mar 17 2020", "developers": ["Zordix Racing"], "platforms": ["PC", "PlayStation 4", "Switch", "Xbox One"], "num_players": "Up to 8 ", "genres": ["Racing", "Simulation", "Automobile"], "meta_score": 63, "users_score": 4.4, "image": "https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/0/b4eec99e7cd3ba36d3fd8a4ccf13d7f4-98.jpg", "descriptions": "In Overpass, the player takes control of powerful buggies and quads, scrabbling across extreme tracks and very hazardous terrain.
