To[Xbox Live Arcade]  The Dishwasher: Dead Samurai is a 2-D stylistic action platformer for Xbox LIVE Arcade showcasing fast action, deep gameplay, and a unique visual style. An undead samurai dishwasher in a dystopian universe is on a quest for revenge against the evil cyborg army. To dispatch hordes of zombies, cyborgs, and robots, the Dishwasher has at his fingertips a devastating array of attacks using ancient blades, disturbing machinery, and screen-obliterating Dish Magic. Compete with the rest of the world in a variety of speed run and high score challenges to become the most formidable Dishwasher yet. Fresh take on gameplay: Gameplay in The Dishwasher is a fresh take on popular stylistic action combat, taking combo- and timing-intensive combat into a 2-D, blood-soaked environment emphasizing speed, vertical movement, and maneuverability, and player-driven pacing to create a truly unique, fluid and visceral experience, with an appealingly psychotic art style. New game modes with guitar peripheral: The Dishwasher has arcade co-op, drop-in solo campaign co-op, and drop-in solo phantom guitar co-op using the guitar peripheral. Phantom guitar players can unload electric death by playing wicked solos, perform basic movement, and use the guitar's motion control to rip through enemies with a razor-sharp headstock. The power of XNA: The Dishwasher is a testament to the power of XNA. The game was created by one guy with no professional game development experience (and a self-described lousy programmer) in about a year and a half. [Ska Studios]\u2026 Expand"

This breakthrough in gaming connectivity allows players on both Nintendo platforms to journey together in the fantastical worldAn innovative new concept in multiplayer gaming, Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Echoes of Time enables Wii and DS users to play side by side for the first time. This breakthrough in gaming connectivity allows players on both Nintendo platforms to journey together in the fantastical world of the beloved Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles series. Echoes of Time offers a gameplay system that allows for a seamless, hassle-free in-game switch from single to multiplayer mode. Play anytime, anywhere, with anyone and experience a new level of connectivity with this latest adventure in the FFCC series. A triumphant return from a monster-infested forest marks the completion of the 16-year-old hero\u2019s coming-of-age ceremony. However, the hero's joy is short-lived as a young village girl is found to be afflicted by a mysterious illness known as \"crystal sickness.\" Determined to obtain the cure, the hero steps out of the secluded village for the first time, only to discover a world in which crystals are merely artifacts of the past and no longer exist. Play anytime, anywhere with anyone Multiplayer connectivity reaches new heights in Echoes of Time, where players can team up or compete with friends and players around the world. The intuitive control scheme introduced in Ring of Fates returns, now adapted to Wii for double the action. Players can switch between single and multiplayer modes at any time while playing, enjoying two great gaming options in one integrated experience. A personalized hero can be generated from a choice of the four familiar races of the series; Clavats, Lilties, Selkies or Yukes. Players joining from the Wii can also introduce their Miis to the world of FFCC. Create and customize materials, armor and equipment for characters with tailored appearances and abilities - no two heroes will be the same! Players can continue to enjoy the game even after completing the main adventure, as the New Game+ feature provides increased difficulty and better items with every new round.

The grandeur of the Roman Empire has been tarnished by political corruption and society has been overrun by unruliness and violence. Julius Caesar advocates for drastic reform to rebuild the republic to its former glory, but is metwith opposition. Before changes could be implemented, the enlightened head of state is murdered. Consequently the horrific news finds its way on the battlefield and to the ears of one soldier, Agrippa, who rushes back to Rome only to be confronted withthe announcement that his father, Uesnius who was a close advisor to Caesar, is the accused murderer. Unfortunately, time is running out for Agrippa as his father is to be publicly executed by the winner of the next gladiatorial event. Together with the help of his best friend, Octavius, and a freed female gladiator named Claudia, Agrippa embarks on a mission to restore his family?s honor and uncover the truth concerning Caesar?s assassination. Shadow of Rome has been designed to allow players the opportunity to venture throughout the world of ancient Rome by flawlessly switching between Agrippa and Octavius, each of whom have their own area of expertise. Playing Agrippa lends itself more to action while Octavius is towards the more stealth and adventure elements of the game. To remain true to the Roman era, players will have to use objects in the environment and weapons of the day such as stones, slingshots, spears and swords in order to progress through the game. Also, situations will arise when Agrippa or Octavius will rely on nothing but their hands in order to combat those impeding his quest to absolve Uesnius. [Capcom]\u2026 Expand"

The story is told through a new set of high-definition live action video sequences starring a celebrity cast. Joe Kucan, the original actor who portrayed the character Kane in Command & Conquer games over the last decade, reprises his role as the megalomaniacal leader of the Brotherhood of Nod. Kane's Wrath also features a new strategic layer to gameplay that allows players to establish bases, build customized armies, and attack their enemies on a global scale \u2013 and then dive into the frenzied tactical combat where their skills as a commander makes the difference in battle. The game introduces six new sub-factions and a wealth of new units, structures, and powers to the armies of the Global Defense Initiative, the Brotherhood of Nod, and the enigmatic alien Scrin. The Xbox 360 version features a revolutionary new radial interface designed specifically for console gamers. Taking RTS controls to a whole new level, players utilize the command stick to build, deploy, and attack. [Electronic Arts]\u2026 Expand"
