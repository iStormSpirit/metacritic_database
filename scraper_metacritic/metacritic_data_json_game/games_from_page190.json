The chaotic assault signals the dawn of a new age of combat and the ultimate instrument of warfare is born, the Mobile Suit. Dynasty Warriors: Gundam 2 combines the devastating power of the Mobile Suit, the rich legacy of the Gundam universe and the furious Tactical Action game play of the Dynasty Warriors series. The game thrusts players into incredible battles against legions of enemy Mobile Suits on distant planetary surfaces and in the far reaches of outer space. For the first time, Dynasty Warriors: Gundam 2 lets players engage in melee battles against colossal enemies such as the Psycho Gundam. The massive Psycho Gundam can quickly reconfigure their bodies into titanic mobile fortresses which can move with remarkable speed. However, highly-trained pilots can utilize their own Mobile Suit\u2019s speed, agility, and of course firepower to defeat these deadly juggernauts. Dynasty Warriors: Gundam 2 also includes new stories featuring mecha from the latest Gundam anime, plus mecha from Char\u2019s Counter Attack and more. With mecha parts collected throughout the course of the game, players can adapt a Mobile Suit which can be piloted into combat.

As a helicopter pilot your missions will take you through the toughest and most dangerous campaigns of the Ia Drang Valley, 1965. The War in Vietnam has become one of the most significant political events of the sixties. After World War II military technologies started developing quickly. One of the most noticeable changes was the all-round usage of military helicopters. Even now, after 40 years, the image of a Huey helicopter is one of the most typical associations with the War in Vietnam and almost every movie dedicated to this topic features these machines. Whirlwind Over Vietnam is a helicopter sim that depicts the most famous episodes of the war in a movie-style way. The main events of the game are well-known to the audience due to famous books and movies dedicated to the War such as We Were Soldiers, Apocalypse Now, Hamburger Hill and many others. The game features all the major weapons and military equipment of that period, both air and land - from firearms, grenade launchers and artillery to planes and vehicles on either side of the conflict. And of course, the main focus is on helicopters. The game contains all major American helicopters with modifications for both US Army and Marine Corps.
