Drivers are rewarded with a growing fanbase that'll cheer them on, react to their every move and support them through victory. One of the new gameplay elements is the dynamic weather system.

This results in changing physics when powering around a corner on the wet or icy surface in Shanghai and St. Petersburg or any of the game's 10 other locations.
