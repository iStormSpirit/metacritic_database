The world comes to life as it immediately reacts to the player's actions and changes accordingly - offering new and exciting challenges. Players can shape their own story by choosing the path of conducting the main conflict and resolving meaningful side-quests. The combat system combines intuitive steering, tactical challenges and movie-like visual experiences. Players can experiment with different careers and even reverse their former choices with the help of \"career changers\".
