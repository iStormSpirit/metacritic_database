Players take command of an entire army including ground troops, artillery, tank divisions and aircraft in all-out strategic assaults. The single-player mode can be played out in two campaigns - American versus German forces on the western front and German versus Russian on the eastern front. Missions will be based on key historic events and operations from 1944. In the summer of 1944, the Second World War entered its end-game when the Allies launched two major operations that would drive back German forces on both the Western and Eastern Fronts at once. In the ultimate test of military strategy, ORDER OF WAR challenges you not only to lead America's finest to victory in the west, but also place you in command of German forces charged with repelling the Red Army\u2019s seemingly unstoppable offensive in the east. Even the keenest military minds will find that it's one thing to make history, but quite another to change it. Do you have what it takes to command? Experience WWII warfare on an epic, cinematic stage; that truly captures the intensity and scale of the battlefield. Command of an entire armed force consisting of up to 1,000 soldiers, tanks, armored vehicles, artillery and air planes. Players can choose between two different campaign modes offering completely different storylines, missions, objectives and environments. Experience the unique dynamic camera that allows players to command troops over huge geographical scale whilst maintaining movie-like vistas and detail. In-depth gameplay mode: two different campaign modes, multi-player, Deathmatch and Skirmish. [Square Enix]\u2026 Expand"}, {"name": "REKT!

What makes it even more portable is that the card collecting experience from the PS3  hit has been streamlined, no longer requiring the PlayStation Eye peripheral nor physical cards to be carried along with you. The PSP version\u2019s digital cards can be earned by playing through the game, traded wirelessly from one PSP to another, won in battle with friends and enemies, and even bought from the PlayStation Store in future downloadable content releases. Each card features a monster, dragon, mage or mythical warrior with their own special skills ready to do battle against your opponent, and some cards are rare to come across. However, players must carefully choose among the cards they have collected to compile their ultimate deck. The cards are not lifeless images \u2013 these creatures come to life on screen springing out of their card and into attack, battling real time as they hack, slash and cast spells on each other. Deploy the right creatures from your deck to defeat your opponent and secure victory.
