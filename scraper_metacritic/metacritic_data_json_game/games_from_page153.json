While Wild Wild Racing may not turn heads in the same way Gran Turismo 3 does, it does look good; and if there's one thing the UK developers like Rage Software are known for, it's creating a solid racing experience. Picked up from Japanese publisher Imagineer by Interplay, Wild Wild Racing has since seen overhauls in the physics, control, and speed. Gamers can ride in nine different vehicles, and race in several global locations during different hours of the day such as night, dusk, and the late afternoon. The game boasts a solid 60 frames per second, and the over-the-top effects that Rage is known for. Control is all analog, meaning even the D-pad (as well as the traditional analog buttons) responds to pressure; the harder you press, the sharper the turn and the faster the acceleration and braking.\u2026 Expand"}, {"name": "Wolfenstein: Youngblood", "details_link": "https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/wolfenstein-youngblood", "publisher": "Bethesda Softworks", "release_date": "Jul 26 2019", "developers": ["MachineGames"], "platforms": ["PC", "Stadia", "Switch", "Xbox One", "PlayStation 4"], "num_players": "2 ", "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "First-Person", "Arcade"], "meta_score": 63, "users_score": 3.0, "image": "https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/2/9f22808febb4066e472688631ce5a413-98.jpg", "descriptions": "Wolfenstein\u00ae: Youngblood is a brand-new co-op experience from MachineGames, the award-winning studio that developed the critically acclaimed Wolfenstein\u00ae II: The New Colossus.

Reminiscent of a Lovecraft horror, NecroVisioN seamlessly mixes the harrowing battlefields with a nightmarish demon and vampire underworld, unleashing a truly visceral experience. The year is 1916 and the Great War has been raging for two long years when Simon Buker, a US army soldier, joins the front line with the allied forces. During the ferocious fighting, Buker and his battalion get lost behind enemy lines while trying to break through to allied positions. While being pushed back into defensive positions they stumble across a series of mysterious trenches where all is not as it seems. As they push forward they discover that there is a greater evil hiding underneath the battlefields of the Great War, an evil which is forcing its way to our world and threatens to change the delicate balance of power. Battling his way through the trenches, Buker uncovers an enemy more deadly than anything he has ever encountered. Demons and vampires wage a brutal underground war, which is spilling into the human world, and Buker finds himself fighting not only for his own survival, but the survival of Mankind.
