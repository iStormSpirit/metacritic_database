There used to be a wide range of different games to choose, from run-and-gun action titles to slow-paced tactical shooters focusing on strategy and tactics, but now most shooters follow the same model of big set pieces, regenerating health, linear levels, and cinematic experiences. The realistic tactical shooters with in-depth planning have almost entirely disappeared in recent years.\r This project, working title TAKEDOWN, aims to change that. This game, the spiritual successor to games like the original Rainbow Six and SWAT series, will focus on realistic weapons modeling, squad based play, in a close-quarters battle setting. To succeed in this game you need to take things slow, study your plans, and execute flawlessly. If you get shot, there are consequences. You wont be hiding behind a wall waiting for your health to regenerate. If a team member goes down, you will have to assess the situation and reallocate team members if necessary to complete the mission. Don't expect all of the tools and plans to be forced fed to you - it is up to the player to ensure their team is equipped and ready for the tasks at hand.\r AKEDOWN is a thinking-persons shooter. The player that takes things slow, aims carefully, and plans their moves right will overcome the player who runs in with guns blazing. Close-quarters battle brings the fight inside, as you would see SWAT teams or SOF units taking down small numbers of dangerous adversaries. Non-linear environments allow for multiple routes and tactics and add replayability. The operation to clear pirates from a hijacked oil tanker by Russian special forces in May of 2010 is a perfect example of the types of missions in TAKEDOWN.\r You will plan your insertions and routes before going into the scenario, outfitting your teammates with weapons and equipment of your choosing, and then execute the mission. If one of your team members is killed, they are gone, and you have lost their valuable experience, so you have to be careful!  Gameplay modes include single player, co-op, and competitive multiplayer.\r If you are a fan of old school shooters where thinking meant more than running and gunning or perks, or if you are just looking for something different in your shooter games experience, this is the project for you.\u2026 Expand"}, {"name": "Destroy All Humans!

Players control Vic in a living, breathing Farmington, engaging in perilous assignments ranging from busting crack dens to thwarting bank robberies.

The game also lets players choose between the right and wrong side of the law, with Vic walking a thin line while trying to accomplish missions, maintain the respect of his men, keep his politically ambitious police captain happy, pad his retirement fund and, above all, avoid Internal Affairs.

The king, a wise ruler with keen insight on keeping his subjects happy, decided that these fighters should do battle not in dingy back alleys and rat infested warehouses like they were used to, but rather they should be able to showcase their aptitude in an officially sanctioned environment. And so the great Arena was built, and the official Coliseum League was birthed. The sport soon became massively popular. From thousands of leagues away, from every walk of life, the citizenry of the kingdom came to witness the carnage in the arena and cheer on their favorite gladiators. And as in any organized professional sport, there were those that managed the teams of warriors. In a sport where the loser is carted off to feed the crows being a manager is no easy task. Warriors must be carefully groomed for battle. Training is an always ongoing process, and when training doesn't seem to be providing the edge managers may turn to dark sorceries and alchemy. In the end, all of this may be for naught, as old age is still the ultimate leveler of man... In Stormcloud Creations' Coliseum players will get the chance to become those managers. You'll guide three young warriors and with rigorous training, and a little dose of the Gods own luck, transform them into seasoned veterans of the Coliseum circuit.
