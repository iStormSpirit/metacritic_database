Defying gravity in vertical combat is only half the battle as, over time, Will is upgraded to a powerful rocket pack which allows for fierce in-air combat as gamers are able to fly through the void at unparallel speeds shooting down anything that gets in their path.

If you can defeat his brutal traps and survive, you may just discover the truth behind what drives this twisted serial killer. SAW is a third-person perspective, survival horror game based on the SAW film franchise.  The game features many of the deadly mechanical traps seen in the film, as well as terrifying new ones. Players pit their wits against Jigsaw as they navigate his world in an attempt to evade and escape his gruesome traps, while also struggling against his minions in brutal combat by using weapons found within the environment. SAW, the video game, is based on a treatment from Zombie Studios and the creators of the SAW franchise, Leigh Whannell and James Wan. The timeline for the game takes place between the movies: SAW and SAW II, giving the game its own story, yet fitting within the narratives of the movies.  The story centers on Detective David Tapp who awakens in a decrepit, abandoned asylum.  He has been captured by his longtime nemesis, Jigsaw. Obsessed with catching this serial killer, Tapp\u2019s mission has consumed him and ruined his family, resulting in divorce, mental imbalance, and abandonment. Worse yet, this frantic hunt destroyed Tapp\u2019s career while he watched his long-time friend and partner get killed by one of Jigsaw\u2019s traps.  Now Jigsaw has the upper hand and has captured the detective. Tapp must play a deadly game - the likes of which he has been investigating for years - to escape, and in order to do so he must survive the lethal traps and puzzles that Jigsaw has put in place for him and others. But each victim has a dark connection to Tapp. Will Tapp save them? Can he survive his obsession to find the Jigsaw killer?

Splatterhouse follows college student Rick Taylor as he tries to rescue his girlfriend, Jennifer, who has disappeared after entering the mysterious and run-down West Mansion. Confronted by horrific other-worldly creatures, Rick comes across a mystical sentient mask that promises to give him the power to find Jennifer. Full of desperation and rage, Rick puts on the \"Terror Mask\" and is transformed into a juggernaut of pure violence and destruction. Featuring an original storyline by critically-acclaimed comic book writer Gordon Rennie (Necronauts, Judge Dredd), Splatterhouse takes Rick beyond the mansion as he scours the ends of the world to rescue his beloved Jennifer. Embodying the unfiltered, primal aggression of its namesake, Splatterhouse gives players countless ways to decimate the mansion's assortment of demons, monstrosities and abominations. Featuring a dynamic combat system, Rick can use his brute strength to perform bone-crushing melee combos, savage grapples and wield an assortment of makeshift weapons including the series' trademark 2x4 and even limbs and heads ripped from enemies themselves. Players can also reanimate the corpses of fallen enemies to fight alongside Rick, imparting strategic depth to the game's battle and unique puzzle systems. More agile than ever before, Rick can now leap great distances and propel himself to out of reach areas by swinging from outcroppings in the environment, adding an all-new level of exploration to the series.
