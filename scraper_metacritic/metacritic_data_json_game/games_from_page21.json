In the Band modes, up to four players can jam together, online or off, as they progress through the game, and in single-player Career Mode, players can jam on any of the instruments in branching venue progression enabling them to rock out in the order of their choice.

As a gun-wielding witch with powers beyond the comprehension of mere mortals, Bayonetta faces-off against countless enemies in a game of 100% pure all-out action. Outlandish finishing moves are performed with acrobatic grace as Bayonetta flows from one fight to another. Bayonetta pushes the limits of the action genre with magnificent over-the-top action and fast-paced, dynamic climax combat.\u2026 Expand"}, {"name": "Outland", "details_link": "https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/outland", "publisher": "Ubisoft", "release_date": "Apr 27 2011", "developers": ["Housemarque"], "platforms": ["PC", "PlayStation 3", "Xbox 360"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer", "Platformer", "3D", "2D"], "meta_score": 84, "users_score": 7.4, "image": "https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/7/cf5701387cbedf76d52ffcf14c280638-98.jpg", "descriptions": "Outland puts players in the middle of a world of balance and chaos where their efforts allow them to bridge the ancient divide, or doom the world to destruction.
