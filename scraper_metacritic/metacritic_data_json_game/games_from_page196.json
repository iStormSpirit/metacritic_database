Tron offers a retro-futuristic test of gaming ability. Race life cycles, demolish tanks, dodge grid bugs, and even face off against the MCP himself to find out who truly rules the computer world! Tron is a perfect recreation of the classic arcade game based on the pioneering computer animated Disney film. Authentic graphics, gameplay and audio have all been upgraded to take advantage of the high-definition graphics and CD bit rate quality of Xbox 360. Now you can be a part of the most famous scene from the movie. Ride your blue cycle and battle the enemy yellow cycles in a gridline battle royale. Exterminate the Grid Bugs and escape into the I/O Tower before time runs out. Demolish all enemy tanks and Recognizers to clear the board. Smash the blocks and move your character into the MCP cone to clear the level. A bonus is awarded if you destroy all the blocks. The original arcade game was single player only. Now, Xbox LIVE Arcade brings you the first version of the game with two-person multiplayer functionality. Multiplayer modes: Split screen and online, co-op and versus, there are lots of ways to playTron. In Versus mode, the players race to achieve the highest score. Try Versus Speed mode, where the first player to reach a host-defined score wins. In Co-op, both players' scores are added together to achieve a high score. And beware the Pressure Cooker where players race to achieve the highest score, but taking the lead after a sub-stage causes the other player's game speed to increase.

He's been taken in by a motley band of escaped alien prisoners on a living ship called Moya. They travel around the galaxy, constantly staying one step ahead of the evil, militaristic Peacekeepers. In this adventure (set during the show's smash first season), Moya is in orbit around an isolated desert planet, recovering from damage. She is suddenly attacked and boarded by a Peacekeeper strike wing. Moya's crew scatters. Some hide aboard the ship; others are captured; a few escape. Crichton, with the alluring Chiana, makes it off the ship in Aeryn's Prowler. They are shot down, and crash-land in the trackless desert. Stranded, unaware of their friends' fates, Crichton and Chiana must find a way to fix their spacecraft and get back to Moya to free their friends. In the meantime, they become mixed up with warring alien factions, and uncover heinous conspiracies and terrible crimes that threaten the stability of the entire galaxy.
