Nuclear winter has given way to a \"superbloom,\" creating a lush, colourful landscape that survivors have begun to re-populate with makeshift buildings. It's a lawless frontier where people are struggling to get by - and you'll be able to experience it all with a friend in co-op, or on your own as a lone gunslinger. After living through the apocalypse, the survivors in Hope County now face a new threat: the nihilistic Highwaymen, vicious scavengers intent on bleeding the county dry. When the survivors put out a call for help to combat this deadly threat, you are quickly thrust into the middle of a new battle for the future of Hope County. Since the nuclear apocalypse, survivors have been piecing their shelter, tools, and weapons together from the broken remnants of the old world. The results may look ramshackle, but they'll keep you alive in a fight. Your Homebase will let you construct powerful weapons and vehicles, giving you more options than ever for explosive, over-the-top action. When anything and everything can happen, it is never too much to have someone watching your back. Whether it's Hurk, a boar, or whoever you want, you can recruit an eclectic cast of Guns and Fangs for Hire to fight by your side.

Motivated by personal revenge, Sean fights, climbs, and races through open-world Paris, sneaking into the heart of the Nazi operations and sabotaging their every move. With the help of the French Resistance, the British intelligence, an arsenal of weaponry, street smarts and brawn, players exact revenge on those who aim to destroy Sean's life. From derailing trains and blowing up zeppelins to scaling famous Parisian landmarks and more, this action hero uses a broad range of weapons, explosives and vehicles to get the job done. As Sean takes down enemies, the citizens of Paris are empowered to resist the tyrannical Third Reich and their eyes open to the colorful world around them. This innovative mechanic, called the 'Will to Fight,' change the way Paris is seen and felt - from a dark and oppressed policed state to a bright and inspired world where the citizens fight back. As the player executes acts of sabotage against the occupying force, color returns to the stylized black and white world - both figuratively and literally. The \u2018Will to Fight\u2019 spawns an underground resistance that takes players not only through Paris, but across various parts of France.
