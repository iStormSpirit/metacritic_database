The game blends the best parts of the movies, comic books in a fantastic new adventure that allows the you to develop your specialized powers as you succeed through your missions. Penned by Man of Action, a studio of comic industry veterans, X-Men: Legends begins with the rescue of a young mutant and takes players through an engrossing plot that could unite mutant-kind, yet destroy the human race in the process. Along the way, players will be able to assemble their ideal X-Men crew from over 15 of the most popular characters from the last 40 years, including Wolverine\u2122, Cyclops\u2122, Storm\u2122, Nightcrawler\u2122, Colossus\u2122, Gambit\u2122 and Beast\u2122, to name a few. However, before players load-up their squad with heavy hitters, they will have to take their foes' abilities into consideration as certain situations may benefit from the abilities of specific X-Men. While Cyclops' optic blasts and Colossus' immense strength are great for clearing a path through hordes of enemies, players can opt to bring Wolverine and Nightcrawler along on a stealth intensive mission to help circumvent detection devices. Once the action begins, players can take control of any member of their squad and even execute multi-character combinations such as the famous Wolverine/Colossus Fastball Special. As they progress through the game, characters will gain experience points that players can use to upgrade the X-Men's abilities and even learn new fighting styles. [Activision]\u2026 Expand"

The action centers around Fallos, mysterious creatures that resemble humans and have an ability to balance on a playing field of 3-D cubes. First, create a pair of Fallos inside your Wii Remote\u2122 controller by shaking it up and down. Next, determine suitable places for the Fallos to land, then fling them to the selected cube with a swinging motion. After that, the Fallos are on their own. If your placement is sound, the Fallos will remain stable and you'll clear the stage after tossing a required number onto the cubes. But if the weight or locations of Fallos causes the cubes to tilt and sway too much, the Fallos will lose their balance and fall off. Adding to the challenge, you'll find that some cubes have different properties, making tosses tricky and further threatening the stability of the Fallos. Guide Fallos through dozens of single-player stages or invite family and friends to join you in two-player cooperative mode. [Nintendo]\u2026 Expand"

Leon is a nobleman about to be engaged to his beloved Sara. However, when his young lover disappears one fateful evening, Leon sets out to rescue her. Armed with only a dagger, it is not until an unexpected ally, an alchemist, offers him a protective whip that Leon is ready to begin his hunt. The rich story of Castlevania: Lament of Innocence follows Leon through the perilous forest and into Dracula's foreboding gothic Castle. Upon entering the castle, players will step into an ethereal world that is guarded by blood thirsty guards and ruled by Dracula's wicked whimsy. Players will face five doors - each one leading into a dark area of the castle - the Cathedral, the Theatre, the Garden, the Alchemist Laboratory and the Dungeon. Trekking through hundreds of rooms, players will battle over 35 different kinds of enemies before facing the final boss. Fighting tooth and nail in each monster battle, Leon must combine his whip and five sub-weapons (Holy Water, Dagger, Cross, Axe and Crystal) to defeat the monsters. Additionally, seven orbs can be combined with 10 action relics in order to create powerful attacks and stunning special effects. Featuring a fixed camera and intuitive controls, Castlevania: Lament of Innocence delivers a groundbreaking action/adventure experience that is designed to satisfy core Castlevania fans as well as players that are new to the series.\u2026 Expand"
