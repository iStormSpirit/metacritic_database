But one day, he and his best friend Golan stumble upon a lost little girl named Meg, and discover something truly terrifying: the moment she starts wailing in fear, a blood-red hue washes over the sky, and the earth itself begins to tremble and quake.That's right: this small girl's tears hold the power to bring forth the apocalypse - and the only way to stop it is for them to help find her mother so she can make it safely back home.Meg's Monster is a short, story-driven JRPG with a big twist. Players control Roy, who begins the game with 99,999 HP and is virtually untouchable - but the real concern is keeping Meg safe, because if she starts crying, it's game over for everyone.
