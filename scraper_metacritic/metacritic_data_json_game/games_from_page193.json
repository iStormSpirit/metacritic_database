After his parents present him with a \"special\" baton that magically attracts band members to fall into rhythm behind the leader, will Major Minor finally fulfill his potential and share the joy of marching with the world? Major Minor's Majestic March marks the return of the creative team behind the renowned PaRappa the Rapper franchise--legendary game designer and multimedia musician Masaya Matsuura and famed New York artist Rodney Alan Greenblat. Your Wii Remote is Major Minor's \"special\" bandleader baton, used to keep tempo, recruit new band members and pick-up valuable items. If your rhythm is unstable confusion will result; band members will drop out and you could ultimately fail the stage. March in 7 different whimsical locations that contain various hair-raising events. Use your best efforts to create the most impressive parade ever whilst nimbly avoiding obstacles. Add 15 different instruments to your procession, from brass to woodwinds to percussion.  As the makeup of the band changes, so does the performance; it all depends on which members you select! Try different combinations each time you play. Numerous modes of play. March and keep tempo to more than 30 well-known marching band tunes from around the world, composed into original medleys for each unique stage.

As terrified hostages fearfor their lives, their only hope lies with a covert operations team, whose goal is to infiltrate the plant and eliminate the merciless enemy. The harrowing events unfold over a 12 hour period, featuring a unique gameplay dynamic which enables the six central characters to experience events across the same timeline but from their own distinct viewpoints. The player controls each character individually, with the focus automatically shifting to a new character at key moments which are unfolded throughcut scenes. By switching between the characters, their individual tales are woven together to create an overall picture of the events that happened during the crisis. The player will also retrospectively view events through the eyes of another character and is therefore not only a participant in the events, but a spectator as well. Furthermore, actions performed as one character affect the progress of others and players must successfully utilize the strengths of each in order to advance. [Capcom]\u2026 Expand"
