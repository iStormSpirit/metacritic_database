Kevin Spacey is Jonathan Irons -- one of the most notorious men in the world -- shaping this chilling vision of the future of war. The game unfolds in a plausible future in which technological, telesis and today's military practices have converged with real world consequences. In this image of the future, Private Military Corporations have become the dominant armed forces for many countries who must outsource their military needs, redrawing borders and rewriting international law.  Irons, the founder and president of the world's largest PMC, Atlas Corporation, is at the vortex of these tectonic plates.\r Suit up for combat in exoskeletons that advance every facet of a soldier's battle readiness, enabling combatants to deploy with an advanced lethality and eliminating the need for specialization. Players tout enhanced player movement and verticality through boost jumps and grappling, covert cloaking abilities, and biomechanics that provide keen strength, awareness, endurance, and speed. With the advent of the exoskeleton and newly advanced armor and weaponry, every soldier commands tactical freedom in any terrain unlike ever before.\u2026 Expand"

Climb Dharma Tower, humanity\u2019s last shelter, after a world-ending cataclysm. Make your way up from the bottom to the top, confront the tyrannical Keymaster, and take your revenge. The streets of this tower city are full of violence. Mara the Keymaster rules with an iron fist and little regard for human life. As resources diminish, the strong prey on the weak and chaos threatens to consume what little order remains. The decisive last stand is coming. A final attempt to set things right before mankind goes over the edge of extinction. As the most advanced blade fighter ever created, you\u2019re always outnumbered but never outclassed. Slice your enemies with a monomolecular katana, dodge bullets with your superhuman reflexes, and employ a variety of specialized techniques to prevail. One-hit one-kill mechanics make combat fast and intense. Use your superior mobility (and frequent checkpoints!) to engage in a never-ending dance with death fearlessly. Ghostrunner offers a unique single-player experience: fast-paced, violent combat, and an original setting that blends science fiction with post-apocalyptic themes. It tells the story of a world that has already ended and its inhabitants who fight to survive.\u2026 Expand"

Active picture-in-picture baserunning delivers both an exciting presentation style and an intuitive method to precisely control runners. The new baserunning mechanic utilizes the right analog thumbstick to choose how baserunners slide -- head or feet first -- in conjunction with hook sliding left or right of the base. Players will be able to reach a base quicker, get up more quickly from a slide, or avoid being tagged out with the new freedom found in Maximum Sliding. Baseburner Mode allows the gamer to play any 'at-bat' through the perspective of any baserunner, delivering precision control to gamers.\u2026 Expand"
