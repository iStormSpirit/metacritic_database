This unlikely hero soon finds himself swept into a desperate struggle for survival at the head of a group called The Survivors. Trapped in the Void, these resistance fighters are battling to hold off a mysterious alien race that plans to threaten Earth. Dark Void's unique combination of in-air and on-ground combat creates a thrilling new gameplay dynamic to the third-person shooter experience. Taking 3D action to a whole new level, Dark Void's vertical combat system allows players to dangle from thousand foot drops as they take cover and drop enemies from above and below, bringing a whole new sense of vulnerability and thrill to the player. Defying gravity in vertical combat is only half the battle as, over time, Will is upgraded to a powerful rocket pack which allows for fierce in-air combat as gamers are able to fly through the void at unparallel speeds shooting down anything that gets in their path. Blasting away at massive bosses has never been this much fun as Dark Void offers a unique grip system made up of a variety of grip-based mini-games including skyjacking UFOs mid-flight.

Each race brings something new as you try winning the race by using any of the strategies or switch between them during the race. The key factor in the game is the SCORE. You collect score while racing. Every stunt that you perform will award you with a certain number of score. Hitting objects, driving fast, drifting they all give you a certain number of score. When you reach 1000 you can burn away your score as nitro thus getting an edge over the others. If you are in the lead you can hit more objects thus gather more score. However hitting objects may cause you to make a mistake and crash into something that is immovable. If you can be patient and gather more than 2000 score, your nitro will be even stronger. Another tactic is to select one of the super cars which are fast and have a good traction. In this case you won't gather that much score but most probably you won't need it because you don't need nitro to stay ahead. Another way to win is to gather your score and never burn it since at the end all score points are converted to time and is subtracted from your overall time and you may jump ahead the winner.\u2026 Expand"}, {"name": "Need for Speed Undercover", "details_link": "https://www.metacritic.com/game/ds/need-for-speed-undercover", "publisher": "Electronic Arts", "release_date": "Nov 17 2008", "developers": ["Firebrand Games"], "platforms": ["iPhone/iPad", "PC", "PlayStation 3", "Xbox 360", "DS"], "num_players": "1 Player", "genres": ["Driving", "Racing", "Simulation", "GT / Street", "GT / Street", "Automobile"], "meta_score": 59, "users_score": 5.9, "image": "https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/6/60c39fb1e4204cf9560f6e6492b307de-98.jpg", "descriptions": "You never thought it could turn out like this\u2014an all-out chase where you\u2019re the hunted.
