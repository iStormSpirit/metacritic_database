Before entering battle, players can wager on which particular enemy soldiers they are going to kill. When they encounter this enemy in the game, a duel will take place. Depending on the outcome, the player will either lose his stake or win a prize calculated according to his opponent's rank, his initial stake, and the length of time it took to win. Accrued credits can be used to upgrade the player's character, in order to challenge progressively tougher opponents. The engrossing single-player game provides the player with an array of Elite Champion AIs, whom you encounter throughout the many levels, each with its own distinctive personality, ensuring variety in betting tactics. This original angle on combat also forms the basis for the multi-player mode, which has a variety of classes available to the 32 players in each game. Each class will utilise the wide selection of weapons in its own specific way.
