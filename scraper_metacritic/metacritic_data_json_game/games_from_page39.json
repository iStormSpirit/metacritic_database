The game drops players into heart-pumping racing action with 20 cars on a track all targeting the finish line and battling each other as they trade paint and collect intense power-ups, including the ability to blast other cars out of the way with huge bursts of energy, boost their speed, and more.

This unique story-driving social network evolves dynamically as players compete in different races, make new friends, rivals and fans, and connect with other racers both in-game and in real life. Looking beyond Blur's single player story, gamers can engage in competitive and team-based multiplayer races with up to 20 players online, or on a single console via 4-player split-screen. Bizarre has also introduced Blur\u2019s original social gaming experience - Custom Groups, where anyone can create unique multiplayer modes based on their favorite ways to play the game. These new modes are immediately shared through Blur\u2019s social network, expanding the game in ways that are only limited by the gaming community\u2019s creativity.

The \"Metal Gear Solid (MGS)\" series is the seminal work of Hideo Kojima, Japan's master game creator, and the progenitor of the stealth action game genre. The series has become a global phenomenon, with over 27 million copies sold worldwide. The player controls a secret agent from an elite special forces unit who is sent on solo sneaking missions through enemy installations, vast jungles, and sometimes even the thick of battle. Alone and surrounded by the enemy, even a special forces agent will find it tough to come out alive. But that is the secret behind the series' popularity-the cerebral challenge of figuring out how to avoid combat, and the thrill of sneaking through enemy territory undetected.The MGS series is also known for its storyline, which blends seamlessly with the gameplay. The scenarios are based on extensive research and incorporate the drama of actual developments in society.

It\u2019s not just the creatures who are aHunt: Showdown is a competitive first-person bounty hunting game that packs the thrill of survival games into a match-based format. Set in Louisiana in 1895, the game boasts a mixture of PvP and PvE elements that creates a uniquely tense experience. It\u2019s not just the creatures who are a threat\u2014it\u2019s every Hunter on the map. In the classic game mode, a match of Hunt pits ten players\u2014playing solo or in teams of two\u2014against each other as they race to take out gruesome beasts for a bounty they must collect and get off of the map, while Hunt\u2019s quickplay mode offers a shorter match for solo players to scavenge for weapons as they compete for a diminishing pool of bounty. The higher the risk, the higher the reward\u2013but a single mistake could cost everything.\u2026 Expand"}, {"name": "The Gardens Between", "details_link": "https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/the-gardens-between", "publisher": "The Voxel Agents", "release_date": "Nov 29 2018", "developers": ["The Voxel Agents"], "platforms": ["iPhone/iPad", "PC", "PlayStation 4", "PlayStation 5", "Stadia", "Switch", "Xbox One"], "num_players": "No Online Multiplayer", "genres": ["Adventure", "General"], "meta_score": 81, "users_score": 7.1, "image": "https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/2/0758a4ff1e93064df6976bac9233d5cf-98.jpg", "descriptions": "Manipulate the flow of time to solve mind-bending puzzles while following best friends Arina and Frendt.
