As players enter their humble town after finding their crown, they are assisted by their advisors, especially Howzer, in taking on missions in the immediate area of town. With the success of each, as well as activities like farming and natural resources development, they will gain wealth in the form of in-game currency called 'Bol.' Once an essential infrastructure has been established in town a suggestion box is set up through which in-game characters can make quest suggestions to supplement those of your advisors. During quests players in the role of young King Corobo can control multiple subjects of his kingdom who follow and serve based on your kingly status. These subjects have different professions which come in handy in specific as well as general quest scenarios and should be chosen wisely. Additional training facilities can be constructed to retrain existing subjects as well as those that are added to your kingdom as it prospers and eventually needs to expand into surrounding territories. The world of Little King's Story is expansive and set on many levels. Although each level contains multiple possible boss battles, progression through the game levels always requires the defeat of a substantial boss. Battles become more intense as you set out to conquer the lands that surround your kingdom, although these are never too overbearing due to the game's easy to alter difficulty settings. As these campaigns against neighboring kingdoms proceed you are kept aware of the health and happiness of your subjects at home and that of your troops via an information bar at the top left, as well as a ticker scrolling across the screen. Balance their needs with the needs of an expanding kingdom and you may indeed become the best king ever.\u2026 Expand"}, {"name": "Morningstar: Descent to Deadrock", "details_link": "https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/morningstar-descent-to-deadrock", "publisher": "Phoenix Online Publishing", "release_date": "Feb 17 2015", "developers": ["Red Herring Labs"], "platforms": ["iPhone/iPad", "PC"], "num_players": "No Online Multiplayer", "genres": ["Adventure", "Point-and-Click"], "meta_score": 62, "users_score": 5.9, "image": "https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/7/c61fb9a3790b3df0cd082050399d8b19-98.jpg", "descriptions": "Morningstar: Descent to Deadrock is a chillingly alien and atmospheric sci-fi first person point-and-click adventure from Red Herring Labs and Phoenix Online Publishing."}, {"name": "Taz Wanted", "details_link": "https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox/taz-wanted", "publisher": "Atari", "release_date": "Sep 18 2002", "developers": ["Blitz Games"], "platforms": ["PC", "PlayStation 2", "Xbox"], "num_players": "1-2 ", "genres": ["Action", "Platformer", "3D"], "meta_score": 62, "users_score": 6.6, "image": "https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/1/c380f349b56a8388165e60e081b18242-98.jpg", "descriptions": "Taz has reached his boiling point in Taz: Wanted--and for good reason.
