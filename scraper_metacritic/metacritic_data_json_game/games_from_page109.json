On his quest, the heroic young Prince finds a companion, 'Box Dog', who aids and accompanies him in his many quests. At the start of his adventure, Prince Pixel finds a magic wand that allows him to bring anything he draws to life. The wand also enables him to temporarily take the shape of any enemy encountered and learn their powers. Prince Pixel can become anything the player draws and transform between three additional different creatures at any given time. As Prince Pixel advances through the game, he gets stronger, tougher, and more skilled. Players also benefit from experience by acquiring more drawing tools and abilities. By the end of the game, players can literally re-create any creature that they've seen in the game with an incredibly easy-to-use drawing program. The game allows the user to draw straight lines as well, so even someone with no drawing skills whatsoever can create just about anything. Players use their imagination to battle their way through levels or creatively solve puzzles.
