The first thing you'll notice when you get your mitts on Flipnic is just how huge the 'tables' are. Based on five different themes, including Jungle, Techno and Metal, these unique worlds contain stunning landscapes, complete with their own individual wildlife, flora and fauna. The first set of tables has a lush tropical look, with butterflies floating over the game as you frantically bash buttons in an attempt to achieve Flipnic's surreal objectives. The challenges include saving pink flamingos from the jaws of hungry crocodiles, destroying UFOs, and feeding hungry monkeys by knocking bananas into their waiting paws. And when you're not putting your mean pinballing skills to the test in single-player mode, you can also throw down the gauntlet to friends in multiplayer modes, with Pinball Soccer and Pinball Basketball available for two-player action. Possibly the most surreal addition to the genre, Flipnic sports beautifully vibrant graphics, intuitive controls, and some of the best ball physics you'll ever encounter in a pinball sim.

From the same team that brought you NHL 09 comes 3 on 3 NHL Arcade, a 3-on-3 experience that throws conventional hockey, and its rules, out the window. Choose from the NHL's top players and bring them into this no-rules hockey game where big hits rule the day. Power-ups: When you see a giant skating down the ice, you'll realize this is not traditional hockey. With eight different power-ups, from speed skating to giant goalie, on-ice mayhem is the only guarantee. Online game modes: Play against a friend one-on-one online or with up to three players a side. With leaderboards and ranked/unranked match options, 3 on 3 NHL Arcade is an experience best shared. Button controls: 3 on 3 NHL Arcade features two separate control schemes, the Skill Stick featured in the past three NHL titles, and all-new button controls. With everything mapped to the face buttons, including all-new trick moves, players of all skill levels will be able to jump right into the action. Trick moves: The new control scheme introduces trick moves and spin moves to the world of NHL. Spin out of the way of an oncoming check before batting the puck out of the air and past a diving goalie. Unique presentation: Bright lights and big heads make their way to the NHL franchise. Featuring exaggerated player looks, and a miniature rink, the game boasts a unique and lighthearted tone throughout. Player types: 3 on 3 NHL Arcade splits 40 of the top NHL players, representing every team in the league, into three distinct player types. Fast players specialize in dangling, Strong players bring extra power to their hits, and All-around players play a solid two-way game of hockey. Hard checking: The all-new physics-based checking engine introduced in NHL 09 makes a return in 3 on 3 NHL Arcade with one slight difference, every hit is huge. Hit a guy just right and don't be surprised to see him fly across the length of the ice.
