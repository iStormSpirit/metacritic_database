The hypnotic nature of their rocking revives the targets with \"Groovy\" energy that boosts their willpower and helps them overcome their obstacles. Every stage is presented in a storyline fashion. All stages share similar basic elements and game flow: The player gets introduced to the target\u2019s problem in a comical intro. Commander Kahn dispatches the agents to the scene. The agents arrive in a special \"Beat Transport\" that is tailor-made for the situation. The song starts as the agents and player meet the target.

After each section, the player gets judged. Depending on the Elite-o-meter's judgment, the story will go well or poorly.
