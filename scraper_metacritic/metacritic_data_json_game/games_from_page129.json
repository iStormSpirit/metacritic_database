Brink uses the familiar shooter controls that you're used to, without frustrating, artificial constraints and takes advantage of a new feature: the SMART button.  When you press the SMART button, the game dynamically evaluates where you\u2019re trying to get to, and makes it happen. No need to perfectly time a jump or vault, the game knows what you want to do. Objectives, communications, mission generation, and inventory selection are all dynamically generated based on your role, your status, your location, your squad-mates, and the status of the battle in all gameplay modes.  You'll always know exactly where to go, what to do when you get there, and what your reward will be for success. Brink\u2019s proprietary technology, Virtual Texturing, breaks new ground on current-gen consoles and PCs with an even greater focus on highly detailed characters, realistic environments, lighting, effects, and atmospherics.

The main hero, Rau, and his trusted spirit guide, Kuzo, return for the sequel along with new, stylized characters, including Tati (Rau?s younger, agile sister with a darker personality). Building on the proprietary combat system, two players will be able to team up (online) with the USB headset and defeat enemies together or play alone using an AI (artificial intelligence) controlled character for a unique cooperative gameplay experience. If playing alone, the second character is controlled by artificial intelligence and a cunning player will observe their actions to learn how to best approach the fighting scenarios when replaying the area as the opposite character. Rau has four weapons in his arsenal: battle axe, Taiaha (spear), broadsword and bow and arrow that now acts as a stealth weapon. Tati has twin daggers, a deadly staff with retracting blades, an axe, a proximity-based weapon and the ability to become invisible in stealth mode. Each character has his/her special skills that can be developed along the way. While Rau is able to use Kuzo the bird to scout unknown territory, distract enemies and retrieve items, Tati can \"spirit walk\" and see through the eyes of the dead. Tati also has the ability to blend seamlessly into the environment and wait undetected, furthering the strategic element of the gameplay.

But Professor Dolores Umbridge's Ministry-approved course of defensive magic leaves the young wizards woefully unprepared to defend themselves against the dark forces threatening them and the entire wizarding community, so at the prompting of his friends Hermione and Ron, Harry takes matters into his own hands. Meeting secretly with a small group of students who name themselves \"Dumbledore\u2019s Army,\" Harry teaches them how to defend themselves against the Dark Arts, preparing the courageous young wizards for the extraordinary battle that lies ahead.
