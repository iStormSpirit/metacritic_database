However, if you've been longing to find in a sport's game such commands as \"Stamp\", \"High Facial Kick\", \"Holding on the Ground\", \"Force Passage\" or \"Ball of Fire\". Then at last you?ve found the game of your dreams. Take charge of a team; place 9 players in your half of the field, then go and put the ball in the opponent?s end-zone. Nothing easier! Except one small detail... there are a few opposition players determined to get the ball from you. On the pitch, as in the changing-rooms, there are no rules. Let yourself be carried away on the gentle airs of doping, corruption and hooliganism even before a match gets under way. Once on the pitch, if the ball doesn?t really interest you, then carry on destroying the opposition using all the underhand tricks at your disposal. If that doesn?t guarantee victory then magic and snares will come in useful. Even if massacring the opposition is encouraged, you?ll have to use far more subtle tactics to have a chance at winning. You?ll have to manage, as best you can, the individual talents of each of your players; take into account the mood of the spectators...to finally be able to get a few points on the scoreboard and make the opposition look foolish.

With plenty of black humour and dark irony, this game immerses the player in twisted parodies of classic fantasy scenarios and characters. Your word is law as you become the all powerful Overlord, a mysterious figure that has inherited the legacy of the evil after being raised from the dead. The game's key innovation is the introduction of an array of impish creatures \u2013 the Minions. Accompanied by a horde of these slavishly loyal rascals, the Overlord plays dirty tricks on anything that moves to become even more powerful. The gremlin-like critters will follow your every instruction no matter how despotic or, for the Minions, life threatening it is. The PS3 version of this game allows you to explore and conquer 5 extra supernatural realms. Defend the Overlord's tower against waves of enemy attack with seven additional online multiplayer maps, including the competitive 'Capture the Maiden' map and 'Protect Your Power'. The Challenge Pack also introduces a 'Legendary' mode, which challenges you by using your most aggressive minion managing skills to complete the single-player game under exceptional circumstances.
