Eets Gameplay is like \"Lemmings Meet The Incredible Machine Plus a Touch of Character.\" Players step onto a rich looking platform of lush grasses against a sunny sky and compel the main character, Eets, to find puzzle pieces or shards placed throughout the game's levels. Eets players progress through the game by acquiring puzzle pieces and by collecting a certain amount, doors will open to new levels such as Smoreland or Kaboom Desert. Players control Eets by feeding him, causing certain emotions and behaviors to erupt based on the food and other props you serve up to him. Get Eets to bite into a tasty chocolate chip and he happily jumps into areas where you want him to progress; give him a sad marshmallow and he will be afraid to move off a cliff. The game is full of suprises from sneezy sows that don't like to be touched and respond by firing off superpigs, to carts that roll and explode when triggered. Players can figure out what makes each element tick and set off chain reactions to get to their desired destination. In addition to the games more than 100 levels, Eets includes a puzzle maker where players can create their own fun by developing levels complete with their choice of music, hurdles, characters, time of day, atmosphere and level of difficulty.

Max is three feet of pure unleashed id with a saw blade grin and the impulsive nature of the average piranha. Together they patrol the sticky streets of a fantastical New York City, righting wrongs, pummeling perps, and ridding the urban landscape of the shifty legions of \"self-propelled gutter trash\" that litter their streets. Sam and Max got their start in comics in 1987, courtesy of cartoonist Steve Purcell. They have appeared in many formats over the years, including two seasons of an episodic graphic adventure game series; an award-winning animated series in 1998; an online web comic in 2006, for which Purcell was awarded an Eisner Award for Best Digital Comic; and The 20th Anniversary Edition of the Surfin' the Highway comic anthology which was nominated for a Eisner Award in 2009. \u2026 Expand"
