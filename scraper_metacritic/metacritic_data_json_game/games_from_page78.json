This is getting weird. Okay, so it turns out there are some rumors that turn out to be true. These spooky specters moved in first, and they don\u2019t let anyone forget it.  Mysterious runes and clay hands appear randomly while crawling vines sprout in the yard. The sacred candle your Sim lit for safety blows out with barely a wisp of smoke. And no one knows where that horrifying doll came from. As the house gets weirder and weirder, goosebumps rise and scared Sims scatter in a panic-induced terror. Luckily, your Sim doesn\u2019t have to deal with this alone! There\u2019s one helpful friend who\u2019s happy to help: Claude Ren\u00e9 Duplantier Guidry (the Ghost). This somewhat flirty apparition offers the secrets to serenity. Under his tutelage, learn how to appease the specters ruining a good night\u2019s sleep. Some specters are playful, other mischievous, and a few are downright ornery. If they leave accursed objects behind, try to tidy up and remove them. Offer gifts or attempt communicating with the specters to try and please them. If they\u2019re satisfied, Sims might get a present in return as the specter fades away. Otherwise, it\u2019s time to turn to the s\u00e9ance table.
