From dogs, cats, caged animals and more, your Sims share new friends to experience life's precious moments. With so many different animals to choose from, there's no telling what unpredictable experiences could occur. Create-A-Pet: Choose from dozens of dog and cat breeds or customize features for a one-of-a-kind pet. You can even modify your pet's body shape by choosing from specific colors and unique markings. Don't like the way they act? Change their personality - from smart and sweet to silly and sloppy - anyone can create their ideal animal friend in The Sims 2 Pets. Your Sims can encourage and discipline pets, training them to shake, roll over, play dead, and more. Unruly pets might dig in the yard, claw the sofa, or topple the trash. Thankfully, a little training can go a long way. Create and control digital characters over a lifetime, setting their goals in life from popularity and romance, to fortune and family- their stories are in your hands. Use special codes to share unlockable pet accessories, fur types or markings with other The Sims 2 Pets players. Take your Sims and their pet for a romp at any of the nearby park areas, or head to the Central Town Park which is a favorite of pet owners. While there, watch your pet play well with others while your Sim can meet others and socialize with fellow animal lovers. Visit the adjoining Town Center, a great gathering spot for Sims that evolves over time. Once you've seen the latest styles and decided on a purchase, deck your pet out in the latest clothing and accessories around. From geek to chic and cool to casual, your Sim can customize their pet's look with one stop in the Town Center.\u2026 Expand"}, {"name": "The DioField Chronicle", "details_link": "https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/the-diofield-chronicle", "publisher": "Square Enix", "release_date": "Sep 22 2022", "developers": ["Square Enix", "Lancarse"], "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PlayStation 5", "Switch", "Xbox One", "Xbox Series X", "PC"], "num_players": "No Online Multiplayer", "genres": ["Strategy", "Turn-Based", "Real-Time", "General", "Tactics"], "meta_score": 66, "users_score": 3.7, "image": "https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/1/b9828803081bca95d969fe7fc020206e-98.jpg", "descriptions": "The world of men is mired by an age of war which rages for year on end.

Lost in transit while on a colonist ship bound for the furthest edge of the galaxy, you awake decades later only to find yourself in the midst of a deep conspiracy threatening to destroy the Halcyon colony. As you explore the furthest reaches of space and encounter various factions, all vying for power, the character you decide to become will determine how this player-driven story unfolds. In the corporate equation for the colony, you are the unplanned variable.\r Key Features:\r * The player-driven story RPG: In keeping with the Obsidian tradition, how you approach The Outer Worlds is up to you. Your choices affect not only the way the story develops; but your character build, companion stories, and end game scenarios.\r* You can be flawed, in a good way: New to The Outer Worlds is the idea of flaws. A compelling hero is made by the flaws they carry with them. While playing The Outer Worlds, the game tracks your experience to find what you aren't particularly good at. Keep getting attacked by Raptidons? Taking the Raptiphobia flaw gives you a debuff when confronting the vicious creatures, but rewards you with an additional character perk immediately. This optional approach to the game helps you build the character you want while exploring Halcyon.\r* Lead your companions: During your journey through the furthest colony, you will meet a host of characters who will want to join your crew. Armed with unique abilities, these companions all have their own missions, motivations, and ideals. It's up to you to help them achieve their goals, or turn them to your own ends.\r* Explore the corporate colony: Halcyon is a colony at the edge of the galaxy owned and operated by a corporate board. They control everything... except for the alien monsters left behind when the terraforming of the colony's two planets didn't exactly go according to plan. Find your ship, build your crew, and explore the settlements, space stations, and other intriguing locations throughout Halcyon.\u2026 Expand"}, {"name": "Destiny 2: Lightfall", "details_link": "https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/destiny-2-lightfall", "publisher": "Bungie", "release_date": "Feb 28 2023", "developers": ["Bungie"], "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PlayStation 5", "Xbox One", "Xbox Series X", "PC"], "genres": ["Action", "First-Person", "Shooter", "Arcade"], "meta_score": 66, "users_score": 2.3, "image": "https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/8/dea2b349c077261dd6bd5207c519c6c9-98.jpg", "descriptions": "The last stand against Calus--who became the latest disciple of The Witness at the end of Season of the Haunted--and a \"pivotal\" moment for the Destiny franchise as it heads to the end of the Light and Darkness saga.
