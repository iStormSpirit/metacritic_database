From using your sharp analytical skills to solve a mystery, to putting your life on the line in an intense shoot-out, or shaking down the bad guy; a detective's life truly seems like life on the edge. Now, Hudson is set to give you a taste of that life with Miami Law, an all new adventure on Nintendo DS that has you saving the world with your fingertips! Miami Law is an action-adventure game packed with all of the ingredients of a prime-time TV show: an intricate storyline with a shadowy terrorist conspiracy, furious shoot-outs in abandoned warehouses, challenging crime-scene detective work and more.  Players will have many opportunities to choose their path and change the story - either as the intense Law Martin from the Miami PD or the brainy Sara Starling from the FBI. Players are presented with different challenges depending on which character they pick - playing as Sara features a puzzle-based element, whereas playing with Law thrusts the player into the action, often into car chases or shoot-outs where taking out the bad guys is the only way to get results.  Unlockable extras, including Texas Hold \u2018Em Poker and Sudoku, are included to take the pressure off players when the tension gets thick.

Players reach this goal by creating a Trioncube \u2013 a series of 3x3 blocks, which start a chain reaction that refuels the space ship. Try to create as big a chain as you can before time runs out and the Trioncube is broken. The bigger the chain you make, the farther distance your ship travels. Featuring four gameplay modes (Arcade, Story, Endless and Vs) Trioncube will provide endless fun for even the most seasoned puzzler. Unlike your typical puzzler where players try to quickly erase as many blocks as possible, Trioncube will have players at the edge of their seats as they try to create the ultimate 3x3 chain in a new type of thrilling puzzle experience. As they progress through the game, players will have to use different strategies to deal with new shapes in order to create the ultimate chain. Players will be able to collect coins as they create the Trioncube chain and purchase various unique Effects and Arts - like sushi rolls, dogs and tambourines jumping out of the Trioncube \u2013 as they travel the galaxy in their Penko.
