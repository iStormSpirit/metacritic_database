Meat Boy and Bandage Girl have been living a happy life free of Dr. Fetus for several years and they now have a wonderful little baby named Nugget. Nugget is joy personified and she is everything to Meat Boy and Bandage Girl. One day while our heroes were on a picnic, Dr. Fetus snuck up on them, beat Meat Boy and Bandage Girl unconscious with a shovel and kidnapped Nugget! When our heroes came to and found that Nugget was missing, they knew who to go after. They cracked their knuckles and decided to never stop until they got Nugget back and taught Dr. Fetus a very important lesson. A lesson that can only be taught with punches and kicks.\r The challenge of Super Meat Boy returns in Super Meat Boy Forever. Levels are brutal, death is inevitable, and players will get that sweet feeling of accomplishment after beating a level. Players will run, jump, punch and kick their way through familiar settings and totally new worlds.\r What\u2019s better than playing through Super Meat Boy Forever once? The answer is simple: Playing through Super Meat Boy Forever several times and having new levels to play each time. Levels are randomly generated and each time the game is completed the option to replay the game appears and generates a whole new experience by presenting different levels with their own unique secret locations. We\u2019ve handcrafted literally thousands of levels for players to enjoy and conquer. You can replay Super Meat Boy Forever from start to finish several times before ever seeing a duplicate level.

Fenimore, of course,  will side with the weakest and will help them take on Starek. After going to a meeting on the farmers, where they tell him about their problems, Fenimore knows what he must do and he feels it even more keenly when he's checked out the whole area, visiting the village, which is also under Starek's control. The sheriff, the banker, the station master and the others all work for the same boss, which means that Fenimore won't be able to count on them, in fact just the opposite, he'll have to take them all on. There's just one person apart from Fenimore on the farmers' side and that the wicked Starek's own niece, a beautiful girl called Rhiannon, who works, against her uncle's wishes, as teacher of the farmers' children. Fenimore, of course, falls straightaway under the spell of the girl, which gives him a good reason to fight even harder for the farmers. Fenimore faces up to endless trials, both great and small as he tries to defend them, taking on Starek's men, first in a fist fight in the village and later with his gun in an ambush. In short: non-stop action, humor, a range of tough but amusing sitations, and all with the unmistakable flabor of the Wild West.

The game focuses on Dan Kaplan, a novelist struggling to write the most important book of his career while trying to be the best husband and father he can be. The Kaplans have come to a remote coastal home for the summer, unaware that they're sharing the house with a mysterious ghostly presence: you. Read the family's thoughts. Explore their memories. Uncover their desires and intervene in their lives. But stay out of sight; you can't help the Kaplans if they know there's a ghost in the house. It's up to you to decide how Dan's career and family life will evolve, but choose carefully; there are no easy answers, and every choice has a cost. Dan's relationships - to his work, his wife, and his son - react and shift in response to your choices. With a different sequence of events in every playthrough, The Novelist gives life to a unique experience each time you play. The decisions you make will define the Kaplans' lives, but they may also tell you something about yourself.\u2026 Expand"}, {"name": "Sinner: Sacrifice for Redemption", "details_link": "https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/sinner-sacrifice-for-redemption", "publisher": "Another Indie", "release_date": "Oct 18 2018", "developers": ["DarkStar Games"], "platforms": ["PC", "PlayStation 4", "Switch", "Xbox One"], "num_players": "No Online Multiplayer", "genres": ["Action Adventure", "General"], "meta_score": 66, "users_score": 5.4, "image": "https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/0/8a8e8b3221692131ae456849983a9a03-98.jpg", "descriptions": "Emerge from the depths a crumbling kingdom and to the challenge of defeating increasingly difficult demonic bosses.
