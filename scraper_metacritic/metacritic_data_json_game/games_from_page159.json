The player's ultimate goal is to conquer the 25 regions of Ancient China and build an entire Empire using cunning diplomacy and uncompromising force. Before each battle, the player will meet with the war council to decide upon military and political policies for the kingdom, then it's time for war. The game gives armchair generals total control of their kingdom. Now, gamers can issue direct orders to each officer or signal general commands to officers on the field. Players will order when the army will take the offensive, defend their ground, or have all officers gather for an ambush. Gamers can also choose the officers for an attack force, entice captives into joining the kingdom's service and even expel officers from the kingdom. There's even greater authority over Government, Product Development, Diplomacy and Battle Tactics with the game's 25 new policies for a total of 75 in all. The game's imperial-sized action includes 4 scenarios to unlock, 2-Player Co-Op play in \"Empire\" and \"Free\" modes, new items to unlock, and control of over 200 officers!

Scientists have refined the code to grow super-enriched \"Godzilla-Matter\" -- a virtually indestructible substance with the exact physical properties as Godzilla's radioactive back spikes.  The Vortaak learn of the Godzilla Matter and strike Monster Island in an attempt to steal G-Cells and seize control of Earth's monsters. As Godzilla, the player awakens and fights to stop the UFOs from stealing G-Cells, and to free his fellow monsters from captivity.  Throughout the game's missions, Vorticia sends waves of monsters, UFOs, mind-controlled military and earth-threatening devices at Godzilla, who must fight to defeat the enemies and find the hidden G-Cells before the UFOs can steal them. The epic battle for Earth will range across the globe in more than a dozen massive, destructible city environments, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, Tokyo, Osaka and New York. Features a variety of online multiplayer options for up to four players where gamers can smash, bash and trash opposing monsters and cities in gargantuan online melees.

Featuring collection of current and near-future military fighter jets, Heatseeker's arsenal includes the stealthy F-22 Raptor, the classic F-15 Eagle, the cutting-edge F35 Lightening II, and the aerodynamically advanced Russian SU-47 Berkut. Heatseeker straps players into the pilot's seat and deliver a white-knuckle ride that'll have them clutching the joypad as they engage in face-melting 6G turns and fight against a seemingly-impossible amount of airborne enemies. And when gamers launch a strike, they follow their missiles as they ruthlessly hone in on their targets via the Impact Cam. Delivering cinematic 3rd-person camera cutaway scenes, the Impact Cam reveals the results of attacks in all their devastating glory from all kinds of dynamic angles, complete with jaw-dropping explosions and smoke trails. With missions across the U.S., down to the Caribbean, across Antarctica and into the Far East, it's high-velocity combat all the way that'll see players constantly switching from predator to prey as an enemy missiles lock on.

In a dystopian world that combines a dark underworld and elements of the fantastic, the player is required to infiltrate the gangs of Paradise City on behalf of a powerful government agency that, despite its influence, has been unable to introduce even a glimmer of law and order to this horribly corrupt city. In an intertwining chapter-driven story, the player takes turns controlling one of three gritty characters that, for their own reason, have \"volunteered\" to get to the bottom of the mystery behind the controlling crime syndicate's power. The player's characters becomes more powerful as they claw their way up the echelons of the underworld and as their individual stories begin to overlap. As the player's influence on the city grows, the businesses, the payoffs and the number of confrontations with rival gangs enables the player to gain experience and become powerful enough to take control of the city piece by piece. After becoming a underworld force to be reckoned with, the player discovers that the gang wars have been masterminded by a secret society, at the head of which are a coterie of terrifyingly dangerous and powerful figures that, it seems, no bullet will stop.
