Kiryu Kazuma \u2013 a former rising star in the Yakuza who is rebuilding his life after serving a 10-year prison term for murder \u2013 suddenly finds himself caught in a spiraling underworld plot involving a mysterious girl known as Haruka and a missing $100 million. Kazuma must use his fists and his wits to stay alive as he unravels the complex web of truth and lies that surrounds the notorious Yakuza. Yakuza delivers a balance of action and adventure with its immersive storyline and stylish fighting mechanics created specifically for the game. Players can string together attack combinations to take out multiple enemies in sidewalk showdowns, while defending the Yakuza territory and reputation by picking up weapons to crush opponents. Kazuma can also \"educate\" delinquent debtors through visceral shakedowns by grabbing and smashing them against walls and tables, then delivering final skull-shattering blows when the Heat Gauge is maximized. With a customizable status gauge, players can increase strength, stamina, and skills through combat.
