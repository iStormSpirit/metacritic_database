The objective of the source(Also known as \"New Rainbow Islands\")  Rainbow Islands Revolution is an update of a Rainbow Islands, the sequel to Bubble Bobble, taking the form of a platform game where the player must ascend through vertical levels that are slowly sinking into the ocean. The objective of the source material is to reach the top of each level, taking out any enemies in the way by firing magical rainbows that can trap or eliminate foes as well as providing bridges for the player to walk on. Rainbows remain onscreen for a short amount of time but can be ?broken? by the player if they jump on them. Once broken, the rainbow will fall off the screen, taking out the first enemy it touches. The game also features a pleasing bonus item system where dispatched enemies leave behind items of food that have varying point values and power-ups that have a range of helpful effects. The major feature of this re-interpretation is shifting the entire game away from traditional controls by implementing a global touchscreen control system which radically alters the way in which the game plays. The game is also displayed across both screens of the DS. Rather than being fired by a button press, rainbows are now drawn directly onto the gameplay area using the stylus and movement is executed by dragging the player?s character around the levels. The objective is still to reach the top of the level, but the time limit has been extended to account for the player being unable to move and use rainbows simultaneously. Rainbows are now broken by pressing the stylus onto them.

Kicking zebras,With a playful new art style, SimAnimals Africa allows players to play with wild African animals while they venture across jungles, deserts, savannas, river deltas and more! Each brand new animal has their own unique skill and it\u2019s up to you to find their secret abilities. Kicking zebras, rock-breaking rhinos and crocodiles that excel at hunting will assist players in keeping the environment happy and unlocking new areas, animals, and special items. New mini-games give players more ways to interact with the animals. The ring toss, drumming, and petting games help the animals hone their unique skill and assist players in achieving their goals more quickly. Additionally, there are over 70 rare objects for players to collect including bugs, fruits and flowers. If players feed one of these rare items to an animal they may get an unexpected surprise! Kids can now choose to play as an animal. Will they water the terrain with their trunk as an elephant, kick fruit off trees as a zebra or jump over riverbeds as a gazelle? Players can have fun developing relationships with wild animals and their babies, and experience the humor and drama of life in Africa.

To get started, you'll line yourself up for a photo - positioning your head and hands as instructed so that your body can become your means to control the madness. You can choose from four game modes to play, each mode featuring five different challenges and hosted by different characters. Whichever mode you opt to play, the fact that it reflects the personality of your host is a guarantee that things will get crazy! In Wario's challenges, you'll have to make big movements with your face and body to succeed - perhaps collecting coins or shaking your head at high speed to dry off a dog! Mona\u2019s mini-games, on the other hand, will require you to line yourself up with targets on the screen. You might have to move your head into place to catch a falling hat or squash a fly just by clapping your hands. In Jimmy\u2019s challenges, you'll play peek-a-boo with a baby, stick fingers up nostrils and dish out a quick massage just by performing the right actions. The remaining set of mini-games are hosted by ninja twins, Kat and Ana. This duo know the value of good friends, which means all their challenges require you to have a sidekick handy.
