With the growth of their army the Soviets realize that they hold the advantage, and are only waiting for the right moment to attack. That moment arrives with the Tempelhof Incident: the near-fatal collision of a US cargo plane and a Soviet fighter over Berlin\u2019s main airfield. A fatal combination of coincidence and human error, there is no point in arguing what went wrong, no point in asking who pulled the trigger first and who fired on whom in return. The Incident went down in history as fatal. Within 12 hours of the crash the ground beneath the German capital is shaking with the salvoes of a war never meant to be: a conflict between former allies over Europe and global supremacy. What if Stalin knew exactly that the USA cannot produce more A-bombs after the war? What if he decides to strike first?

Uncover the chilling mysteries of this RPG-investigation game, descending deep into a world of cosmic horrors, creeping madness, and shrouded Old Gods within Lovecraft's iconic universe.\r The Cthulhu Mythos has been fascinating audiences for generations, growing to become one of the largest shared universes ever envisioned and giving birth to countless stories, novels, movies, tabletop and videogames since the original publication of H.P. Lovecraft's The Call of Cthulhu. Adaptions and references have formed a widespread legacy stretching back to the very beginning of the 20th century, latching on to the key fear of the human psyche: that of the unknown. Now, Call of Cthulhu will bring the mythos to life like never before, on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC.\r In this world, nothing is as it seems. Sanity is an irregular bedfellow, all too often replaced by the whisperings in the dark. Strange creatures, weird science, and shadowy cults dominate the Cthulhu Mythos, intent on realizing their mad schemes to bring about the end of everything. Your mind will suffer -- balancing a razor-thin line between sanity and madness, your senses will be disrupted until you question the reality of everything around you. Trust no one. Creeping shadows hide lurking figures... and all the while, the Great Dreamer prepares for his awakening.\u2026 Expand"}, {"name": "MySims SkyHeroes", "details_link": "https://www.metacritic.com/game/wii/mysims-skyheroes", "publisher": "Electronic Arts", "release_date": "Sep 28 2010", "developers": ["Electronic Arts", "Behaviour Interactive"], "platforms": ["PlayStation 3", "Xbox 360", "Wii"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Miscellaneous", "Virtual Life", "Virtual", "Virtual Life"], "meta_score": 67, "users_score": 5.3, "image": "https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/8/5a48c1e6accd3da9ebd92da4f6e79a98-98.jpg", "descriptions": "In MySims SkyHeroes, players take to the sky to lead the resistance against Morcubus and his drone army and to stop his plans to take over the skyways.

Set to revolutionise multi-terrain, multi-vehicle racing, FUEL is a fiercely competitive game without boundaries. On and off-road, two and four-wheeled vehicles race a massively diverse environment, from scaling the highest snow-capped mountain to racing the deepest arid canyon. In a fictional present, vast swathes of the United States have been ravaged by the extreme effects of accelerated global warming: tornados, brush fires, hurricanes and tsunamis have driven people from their homes leaving huge areas of America abandoned. Now these dangerous areas have created the perfect playground for a new breed of adrenaline junkies who set out to conquer each other, and Mother Nature, in closely fought races. There are over 70 different vehicles with which to take on any challenge that FUEL\u2019s stunning environment throws at you. On-road and off-road bikes, cars, quads, trucks, buggies and dragsters take dangerous short-cuts, perform death-defying jumps and tear through spectacular cross-over points. FUEL's landscape is powered by cutting-edge technology and, using satellite data, features some of the most exciting and inspiring areas of America - including the Grand Canyon, Yosemite National Park, Mount Rainier and much more. In FUEL, if you can see it, you can drive to it, taking any route - on or off-road - that you want.  With a draw distance of 40KM, 100,000 miles of roads, tracks and trails and hundreds of race events FUEL\u2019s epic world demands to be explored.
