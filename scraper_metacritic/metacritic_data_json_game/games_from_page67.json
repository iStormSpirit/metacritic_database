Arena Wars is a single and multiplayer game. Multiplayer supports up to 8 players, who can fight against each other and challenge other players from all around the world via the AW Server, whilst the single player mode is loaded with action-packed single player missions against one or more computer opponents. There are 3 different game modes: Capture the Flag, Bombing Run, and Double Domination. In AW the goal is not simply to destroy the enemy's base or units. To score points in the various scenarios you must complete objectives that range from stealing the enemy flag, carrying a bomb into your enemy's base or seize and hold Domination zones for a period of time. The winner is the player who satisfies that particular game's objectives. For example, in a Capture the Flag game with a 'capture limit' of 5, the winner is the first player to capture 5 enemy flags.

Universe at War: Earth Assault is set in the near-future when multiple factions from across the galaxy have come to Earth to wage epic warfare. Containing numerous features and customization options never-before-seen in the RTS genre, Universe at War: Earth Assault creates an exceptional strategy experience for single-player and especially multiplayer battles. The game employs a unique balance system called \"Tactical Dynamics\" that allows players to retrain and customize units in the midst of battle to better cope with enemy forces and tactical situations. Weaponry and defenses can be modified in true real-time to take advantage of constantly shifting battlefield conditions. Fully customizable tech trees allow players to control the development of technologies that they deem key to victory. Battles in Universe at War: Earth Assault are large in scope and take place in malleable and deforming environments. Deadly sci-fi weapons and alien powers will allow players to destroy cities and whole territories on a global scale. Because the world of Universe at War: Earth Assault is persistent, players can revisit previous battlegrounds to find them still smoldering in ruins. The game gives players achievements, rewards, and medals in a balanced environment to further encourage players to move forward in the game.
