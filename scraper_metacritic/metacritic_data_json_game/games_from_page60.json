Over five alternating turns taking place in a 25\u201d time-loop, you are called to master the unique abilities of a varied cast of deep-space operatives and outskill, outsmart, and outmanoeuvre your opponent in mind-bending four-dimensional battles. Lemnis Gate twists time to subvert one of the world\u2019s most popular game genres and offers a relentlessly inventive multiplayer experience deeply rooted in tactical FPS gameplay. Challenge yourself to think across four dimensions as you embark on the ultimate test of cognition and combat.\r Matches in Lemnis Gate take place within time loops. You have 25 seconds to execute your action, be it blasting an enemy, manoeuvring your operative, or setting up your next move. After all players have taken turns, the next 25-second round begins. Now you\u2019ll face what has happened while setting up what will happen. Each of the five rounds is your chance to alter the timeline as past, present, and future converge.\r STRATEGIC COMBAT IN THE FOURTH DIMENSION\rVictory doesn\u2019t rely on shooting supremacy. You\u2019ll have to use skill and strategy to create unstoppable game plans and get the drop on opponents. It\u2019s all about non-linear logic, abstract thinking, and outlandish manoeuvres. Execute audacious acts and think several moves ahead to get the win.\r A TIME-BENDING TACTICAL SHOOTER\rWith a varied cast of characters to choose from, how you play is up to you. Lay damaging toxic waste in your enemy\u2019s path, slow time to land the perfect shot, or deploy protective orbs to assist your future self. Every operative possesses a distinctive loadout and special ability that proves decisive on the battlefield.\r TEAM UP WITH YOURSELF\rWelcome to the team comprised entirely of one: you. With Lemnis Gate\u2019s innovative auto co-op feature, you command every member of your side. Auto co-op gives you total control of five deep-space operatives, effectively enabling two competitors to duke it out in bustling ten-character matches. Become a literal one-person army.\r COUNTLESS POSSIBILITIES, ENDLESS OUTCOMES\rFrom the first second to the last, anything can happen in Lemnis Gate. Each round is a fresh chance to implement an unbeatable new strategy \u2013 or earn redemption from an earlier error. Predict hostiles\u2019 routes, infiltrate enemy lines, and develop multi-layered gameplans by co-operating with yourself. Experiment both in and outside time, and get creative with causality.\u2026 Expand"}, {"name": "Samurai Warriors 5", "details_link": "https://www.metacritic.com/game/switch/samurai-warriors-5", "publisher": "Koei Tecmo Games", "release_date": "Jul 27 2021", "developers": ["Koei Tecmo Games"], "platforms": ["PC", "PlayStation 4", "Xbox One", "Switch"], "num_players": "No Online Multiplayer", "genres": ["Action", "Beat-'Em-Up", "3D"], "meta_score": 78, "users_score": 8.0, "image": "https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/7/b7c12bf16ad98fdd8619f2570ef1eea0-98.jpg", "descriptions": "Experience exhilarating action set in a dramatic historical setting in SAMURAI WARRIORS 5.
