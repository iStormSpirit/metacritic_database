If his mission fails, control of the world's Atomic technology will fall into the hands of Stalin and the Soviet Army, throwing the world's political climate into chaos. In the undercover mission, players utilize their sniper training to gain access to key positions by taking out machine guns, armored vehicles, guard posts and sentries through stealth and pinpoint accuracy.

In taking aim at enemy soldiers, players need to consider gravity, wind speed, heart rate, breathing and posture to successfully hit their target in one of the most authentic sniping mechanics ever devised.
