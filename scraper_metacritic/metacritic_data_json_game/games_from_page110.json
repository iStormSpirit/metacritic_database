Blaze through enemy fleets and turrets around massive spaceships, tumbling asteroid fields and snaking planetside canyons. Shadows and lights dance through the galaxy in real-time as your ship darts between guns, missiles and explosions, all of which create their own light source. Your wingmen take care of themselves and will actually assist you in missions, requiring no input. The weapons system -- with Ship-to-Ship missiles, Ship-to-Ground missiles, photon torpedoes, and a plasma glob launcher in addition to the primary lasers, all on the ship simultaneously ? is enough to satisfy any gun nut. Particularly entertaining is how every explosion in the game blows up magnificently, with columns of light racing into the sky as energy pierces through spectrums. [Merscom]\u2026 Expand"

Nuclear winter has given way to a \"superbloom,\" creating a lush, colourful landscape that survivors have begun to re-populate with makeshift buildings. It's a lawless frontier where people are struggling to get by - and you'll be able to experience it all with a friend in co-op, or on your own as a lone gunslinger. After living through the apocalypse, the survivors in Hope County now face a new threat: the nihilistic Highwaymen, vicious scavengers intent on bleeding the county dry. When the survivors put out a call for help to combat this deadly threat, you are quickly thrust into the middle of a new battle for the future of Hope County. Since the nuclear apocalypse, survivors have been piecing their shelter, tools, and weapons together from the broken remnants of the old world. The results may look ramshackle, but they'll keep you alive in a fight. Your Homebase will let you construct powerful weapons and vehicles, giving you more options than ever for explosive, over-the-top action. When anything and everything can happen, it is never too much to have someone watching your back. Whether it's Hurk, a boar, or whoever you want, you can recruit an eclectic cast of Guns and Fangs for Hire to fight by your side. You can even play with a friend in co-op.\u2026 Expand"

Fighter, Sorcerer and Rogue.  The player controls one party member at a time -- switching between them on the fly -- while the other party members are controlled by the engine?s sophisticated artificial intelligence.  For example, when the player controls the Fighter, the Sorcerer and Rogue will continue to engage in combat, cast spells and assist the player in defeating all challengers.  In many situations, the characters will be able to divide and conquer difficult objectives ? while the Fighter holds back a horde of Yuan-Ti snakemen with brute force, the Sorcerer supports him with devastating ranged magic while the rogue sneaks above and behind them for a coup de grace.  The player participates seamlessly in each critical moment as they are cinematically switched from one perspective to another. This real-time, on-the-fly character switching design allows Forgotten Realms: Demon Stone to challenge players with innovative and compelling encounters.  In true D&D fashion, each of the characters excels at a certain type of gameplay.  The Fighter thrives in melee combat, the Sorcerer is excellent at ranged and magical combat and the Rogue excels at jumping, sneaking and disarming traps.  Players will be continually tasked with choosing the best character for each challenge as well as using each character?s gameplay specialty to maximum effect. [Atari]\u2026 Expand"

Thanks to the official ICC Cricket World Cup 2007 content, Brian Lara International Cricket 2007 features licensed players, including world cricket stars Andrew Flintoff, Ricky Ponting, Mahendra Dhoni, Muttiah Muralitharan and of course, Brian Lara himself. In addition to players, the game leads with a dedicated ICC Cricket World Cup 2007 mode featuring all the official teams, stadia, kits and equipment of the tournament. Further modes include a fully licensed ICC Champions' Trophy competition and exhibition matches including One Day Games, Test Matches and exciting 20-over run fests. When you want to get competitive for real, Brian Lara International Cricket 2007 will deliver with online competitive play on PC (LAN and online) and Xbox Live. BLIC 2007 adds extra depth to the series' complete batting, bowling and fielding experience whilst retaining its trademark accessible playability. The batting play sees the introduction of subtle edges, sweepshots and the ability to use your feet to dance down wicket and smash the ball over the boundary for six. Bowling sees an improved set of delivery types, thanks to changes in the way the ball swings in the air and reacts off the pitch, showcasing Shane Warne's huge variation of spinning deliveries and Steve Harmison's raw pace and even reverse swing as the ball degrades. In Fielding, there's a new reflex-testing slip catch system and players can now be run out at both ends and be stumped by alert wicket keepers. [Codemasters]\u2026 Expand"

The player must work with friction, momentum, and the unique properties of each type of fluid and environment to send as much of each puddle past fires, rifts, potential spills and more. But watch out: the fluid motion is realistic!  Tilt too quickly and some droplets are left behind; tilt too slowly you may not be able to make certain jumps\u2026 or may simply evaporate away.\u2026 Expand"

The Humans that adventure pastPhantasy Star \u00d8 takes place on an alternate Earth 200 years after the Great Blank, a massive war that has reduced the once-prosperous civilization to almost nothing.  The sole surviving Humans have worked hard to exist peacefully and have built thriving Cities. The Humans that adventure past the outskirts of these Cities, called Hunters, explore the vast wilderness and hunt dangerous monsters to keep Cities safe.  Players will take up the role of Hunters and select from three types of races and different classes, as well as gender for a total of 14 customizable character types.  Each character type will play very differently and give players access to a great range of items, armor and weapons.  Featuring over 350 unique weapons, gamers will venture out on Earth, combat dangerous monsters to gain experience and meet new major characters. As players explore further, they will unravel the mystery of the Great Blank and discover a dangerous new force that must be stopped. Featuring both wireless and full Wi-Fi multiplayer options, Phantasy Star \u00d8 takes advantage of the touch screen capabilities of Nintendo DS with the new Visual Chat feature. Gamers can now design their own Visual Chat commands that can be used in multiplayer modes. These Visual Chat commands will be displayed as text bubbles above the user\u2019s character, enabling easy and fun communication when adventuring with friends. [Sega]\u2026 Expand"
