The game was inspired by Sig, Edgar and Norman Hansen -- three brothers who have made their living crab fishing on the Bering Sea aboard their family's fishing vessel, the Northwestern. Deadliest Catch Alaskan Storm lets gamers captain their own boat in the frenzied search for an undersea jackpot. Gamers select one of five real crab boats, including the Northwestern, Cornelia Marie and Sea Star -- all featured on the series, or create and customize their own boat. Gamers then recruit and lead their own crew from a roster of twenty real crab fishermen. Selecting the wrong boat or recruiting the wrong crew member can mean the difference between landing a Bering Sea jackpot or disaster. Lead your fatigued, hungry and hardworking crew in the strategic search for King Crab and Opilio Crab, while battling to secure your catch and livelihood before other captains and crews get to the crab first.

Gamers can play as their favorite Turtle alone or with up to three friends, earning experience points along the way as they slash and bash Foot Ninjas and powerful, well-known bosses from the TMNT universe. These experience points allow players to improve and evolve their Turtles' traits and abilities for more varied, powerful attacks and moves. The Ninja Scroll System is another new feature on TMMT3. Being able to select which ninja scrolls to use allows the Turtles to use various special abilities strategically. Cooperative play lies at the heart of TMNT3 and gamers who team up with friends for multiplayer action are rewarded with exclusive features such as Cooperative Attack for even more shell shocking damage to enemies. The effect of this attack changes depending on the number of players working together (between 2-4 players). For even greater control, TMNT3 features a new combat system called the Target Attack system that lets gamers play more instinctively and strategically. With the Target Attack system, players will be able to lock onto specific enemies and block, dodge or counter attack accordingly for smoother and more maneuverable combat. Story Mode can be played with 1-4 players. Even when you have less than 4 players to play, the other Turtles will be at your side, controlled through AI. All the Turtles can participate in Cooperative Attack to beat enemies and players can give commands to the AI.\u2026 Expand"}, {"name": "Coded Arms: Contagion", "details_link": "https://www.metacritic.com/game/psp/coded-arms-contagion", "publisher": "Konami", "release_date": "Sep 18 2007", "developers": ["Creat Studios"], "platforms": "PSP", "num_players": "8  Online", "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Shooter", "3D", "First-Person", "Sci-Fi", "Sci-Fi", "Arcade"], "meta_score": 56, "users_score": 6.8, "image": "https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/1/bbfff1956bcea8e0759ab74a7a9db297-98.jpg", "descriptions": "Coded Arms: Contagion thrusts players into a new cybernetic crisis where they must use their hacking abilities and an arsenal of high-powered weaponry to survive.
