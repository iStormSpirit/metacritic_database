Take on missions ranging from cross-town delivery to mining in a canyon to defeating bandits. The money and fame points earned can be used to upgrade your Trotmobile and enter arena battles.

Instead, there are tons of customization options, letting you upgrade your arms, legs, heads, bodies, and more, each changing the nature of how you battle!
